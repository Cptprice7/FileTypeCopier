# FileTypeCopier
This will copy all files of a certain type (i.e .txt .mp4 .pdf) from one folder to another folder (if the folder does not exist it will be created)

Example: I want all of the .pdf files from downloads, so i would copy the files path from my download folder C:\users\Tj\Downloads and i would then paste it for the first prompt.

For the second prompt i would type .pdf and for the third i would do the same as the first except with what folder i want the files to be copied to.

For the third prompt you can add folders with this script, i.e i paste C:\users\Tj\desktop but i want a folder called copiedItems i would add \copiedItems at the end, so the final path would be C:\users\Tj\desktop\copiedItems.
